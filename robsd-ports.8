.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility builds
.Ox
ports using
.Xr dpb 1 .
The process is divided into the steps as follows:
.Bl -tag -width distrib
.It env
Dump the current environment.
This is a no operation only used to collect data useful while debugging.
.It cvs
Update or checkout the
.Ic ports-dir
source directory.
This step is optional and requires presence of certain configuration, see
.Xr robsd-ports.conf 5 .
.It clean
Remove all build artifacts.
.It proot
Create the
.Ic chroot
using
.Xr proot 1 ,
this is where ports are built.
.It patch
Apply patches including sticky ones, see
.Xr robsd-ports.conf 5 .
.It dpb
Build all configured
.Ic ports
using
.Xr dpb 1 .
.It distrib
Distribute the packages for all configured
.Ic ports
including runtime dependencies to another host using
.Xr scp 1 .
This step is optional and requires presence of certain configuration, see
.Xr robsd-ports.conf 5 .
.It revert
Inverse of patch step.
.It dmesg
Take a copy of
.Xr dmesg 8 .
.It end
Auxillary step used to generate
.Pa report .
.El
.Pp
Each invocation is identified by a directory created by
.Nm
rooted in
.Ic robsddir
and is named after the current date.
The directory contains the entries as follows.
.Bl -tag -width robsd.log
.It Pa comment
File used to annotate the invocation which is included in
.Pa report .
By default, it contains a list of all applied patches.
.It Pa dmesg
Copy of
.Xr dmesg 8 .
.It Pa report
A summary delivered as a mail to root while running in the background once
.Nm
exits.
.It Pa robsd.log
Standard output and error from
.Nm
while running in the background.
.It Pa stat.csv
Collected statistics, see
.Xr robsd-stat 8 .
.It Pa step.csv
Internal representation of the executed steps, see
.Xr robsd-step 8 .
.It Pa tags
Tags included in
.Pa report .
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is configured using
.Xr robsd-ports.conf 5
and must run as root.
Some steps can however operate on behalf of another user.
By default,
.Nm
runs in the background and must be killed using
.Xr robsd-kill 8
to ensure a clean exit.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not detach
.Nm
into the background.
.It Fl P Ar ports-patch
Patch to apply to
.Ic ports-dir .
The patch path names can be relative to any directory in
.Ic ports-dir .
The same patch will be reverted by the revert step, see above.
In addition, a copy of the patch is saved to a file named
.Pa ports.diff.N
in the invocation directory where N is incremented for every given patch.
May be given multiple times.
.It Fl c Ar comment
Path to comment included in
.Pa report .
.It Fl r Ar path
Resume an invocation located at
.Ar path .
.It Fl s Ar step
Skip
.Ar step ,
see enumerated steps above.
.It Fl t Ar tag
Arbitrary tag used to annotate the invocation which is included in
.Pa report .
May be given multiple times.
.It Ar pkgpath
Build the given port expressed as a
.Xr pkgpath 7
as opposed of the configured
.Ic ports .
The following steps will be skipped: cvs, clean, proot and distrib.
